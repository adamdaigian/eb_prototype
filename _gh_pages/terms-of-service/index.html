Company may change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Software or Support including, without limitation, the availability of any Software feature, database, or content at any time without prior notice to you.  Company may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Support, Support or the Company Internet site(s) without notice or liability.

<p>8. CONFIDENTIALITY.  You agree that you shall not disclose to any third party the Software or any portion thereof, any technical, product, or business information, or any information that Company identifies as confidential (collectively, “Confidential Information”) related to the Software without the prior written consent of Company.  You shall maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information and shall not use it for any purpose other than the performance of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information that you can demonstrate was (a) publicly available at the time of disclosure, or later became publicly available through no act or omission by you; (b) in your possession before disclosure by Company; or (c) disclosed to you by a third party not in violation of any obligations of confidentiality to Company or to any third party.</p>

<p>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

In addition, in no event shall you be entitled to obtain any injunctive relief or otherwise enjoin, restrain, or otherwise interfere with Company or with the distribution, operation, development, or performance of the Software or any related products.</p>

<p>THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR CLAIMS OR LIABILITIES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS AND LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY.  THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE, ANY DATA ACCESSED VIA THE SOFTWARE, OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE OR ACCESS THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER CLAIMS FOR SUCH DAMAGES ARE BROUGHT UNDER THEORY OF LAW OR EQUITY.  DAMAGES EXCLUDED BY THIS CLAUSE INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, INJURY TO PERSON OR PROPERTY, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR PERSONAL INFORMATION.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES SO THIS RESTRICTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THE SOFTWARE MAY BE DELAYED, INACCURATE, OR CONTAIN ERRORS OR OMISSIONS, AND THE COMPANY WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY WITH RESPECT THERETO.  COMPANY MAY CHANGE OR DISCONTINUE ANY ASPECT OR FEATURE OF THE SOFTWARE AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE TO YOU, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CHANGES TO AVAILABLE CONTENT OR HOURS OF AVAILABILITY. </p>

<p>10. AS-IS, NO WARRANTY.  THE SOFTWARE AND ANY DATA ACCESSED THROUGH THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," AND ANY USE THEREOF IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.  ANY MATERIAL OR SERVICE DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD AND/OR USE OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL OR SERVICE.  COMPANY, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AGENTS, AFFILIATES, AND ASSIGNS (COLLECTIVELY, "COMPANY ENTITIES") AND COMPANY LICENSORS DO NOT REPRESENT THAT THE SOFTWARE OR ANY DATA ACCESSED VIA THE SOFTWARE IS APPROPRIATE OR AVAILABLE FOR USE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.  THE COMPANY ENTITIES AND COMPANY LICENSORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE AND ANY DATA ACCESSED VIA THE SOFTWARE, OR THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, OR ADEQUACY OF THE SOFTWARE AND ANY DATA ACCESSED VIA THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AS WELL AS ANY WARRANTIES ALLEGED TO HAVE ARISEN FROM CUSTOM, USAGE, OR THE COURSE OF DEALING BETWEEN THE PARTIES.  COMPANY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.  IN ADDITION, COMPANY DOES NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE SOFTWARE AT ALL TIMES.  YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT INTERNET CONGESTION AND OUTAGES, AS WELL AS MAINTENANCE, DOWNTIME, AND OTHER INTERRUPTIONS, MAY INTERFERE AT TIMES WITH YOUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE SOFTWARE.  IF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY DATA ACCESSED VIA THE SOFTWARE PROVES DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL REPAIR OR INJURY OF ANY KIND, EVEN IF THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH A DEFECT OR DAMAGES.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW RESTRICTIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES SO SOME OF THESE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<p>11. GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by and be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.  You agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts situated in San Francisco, California. The United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement</p>

<p>12. ARBITRATION.  You agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between you and Company.  Your agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.  You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you are waiving your right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.  Any arbitration hereunder will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.  The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  The arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement.  All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide.  Any arbitration hearings will take place in San Francisco County, California.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.  Payment of all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated hereunder will be governed by the AAA Rules.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  Further, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>

<p>13.  FORCE MAJEURE.  If the performance of Company under this Agreement is prevented, hindered, or otherwise made impractical by reason of flood, strike, war, acts of government, or any other casualty or cause beyond the control of Company, then Company shall be excused from its performance to the extent and so long as it is prevented, hindered, or delayed by such event(s).</p>

<p>14. SEVERABILITY.  If any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, then to the maximum extent permitted by law, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement.</p>

<p>15. NO ASSIGNMENT.  You may not assign this Agreement or any of the rights granted by Company hereunder, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of Company, and any attempt to do so shall be void.  This Agreement is binding on and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.</p>

<p>16. EXPORT CONTROL.  You agree to obey and comply with any and all applicable United States laws, rules, and regulations governing the export of software.</p>

<p>17.  GOVERNMENT END USERS.  If the Software and Documentation are supplied to or purchased by or on behalf of the United States Government, then the Software is deemed to be "commercial software" as that term is used in the Federal Acquisition Regulation system.  Rights of the United States shall not exceed the minimum rights set forth in FAR 52.227-19 for "restricted computer software."  All other terms and conditions of this Agreement apply.</p>

<p>18.	NO GENERAL WAIVER.  The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. </p>

<p>19.	COMPLETE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement and the ElasticBox Terms of Use (the “TOU”) constitute the entire understanding between the parties respecting use of the Software.  In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and those in the TOU, the terms and conditions of the TOU will control, except to the extent that this Agreement imposes additional restrictions and liabilities on your actions.</p>

<p>20.	STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.  Any claim related to this Agreement, the Software, or the use thereof must be brought within one (1) year of the date when the claim could first have been filed.  If not brought by such date, such claim is permanently barred.</p>

<p>21.	INTERPRETATION.  The headings of the paragraphs in this License are for convenience of reference only and do not affect the meaning or interpretation of this License.</p>

<p>22. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, UNDERSTAND IT, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  THIS AGREEMENT MAY NOT BE CHANGED, ALTERED, OR MODIFIED EXCEPT BY A WRITING SIGNED BY THE PARTIES</p>
