<p>11. GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by and be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.  You agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts situated in San Francisco, California. The United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement</p>

<p>12. ARBITRATION.  You agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between you and Company.  Your agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.  You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you are waiving your right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.  This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.  Any arbitration hereunder will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.  The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  The arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement.  All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide.  Any arbitration hearings will take place in San Francisco County, California.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.  Payment of all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated hereunder will be governed by the AAA Rules.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  Further, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>

<p>13.  FORCE MAJEURE.  If the performance of Company under this Agreement is prevented, hindered, or otherwise made impractical by reason of flood, strike, war, acts of government, or any other casualty or cause beyond the control of Company, then Company shall be excused from its performance to the extent and so long as it is prevented, hindered, or delayed by such event(s).</p>

<p>14. SEVERABILITY.  If any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, then to the maximum extent permitted by law, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement.</p>

<p>15. NO ASSIGNMENT.  You may not assign this Agreement or any of the rights granted by Company hereunder, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of Company, and any attempt to do so shall be void.  This Agreement is binding on and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.</p>

<p>16. EXPORT CONTROL.  You agree to obey and comply with any and all applicable United States laws, rules, and regulations governing the export of software.</p>

<p>17.  GOVERNMENT END USERS.  If the Software and Documentation are supplied to or purchased by or on behalf of the United States Government, then the Software is deemed to be "commercial software" as that term is used in the Federal Acquisition Regulation system.  Rights of the United States shall not exceed the minimum rights set forth in FAR 52.227-19 for "restricted computer software."  All other terms and conditions of this Agreement apply.</p>

<p>18.	NO GENERAL WAIVER.  The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. </p>

<p>19.	COMPLETE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement and the ElasticBox Terms of Use (the “TOU”) constitute the entire understanding between the parties respecting use of the Software.  In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and those in the TOU, the terms and conditions of the TOU will control, except to the extent that this Agreement imposes additional restrictions and liabilities on your actions.</p>

<p>20.	STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.  Any claim related to this Agreement, the Software, or the use thereof must be brought within one (1) year of the date when the claim could first have been filed.  If not brought by such date, such claim is permanently barred.</p>

<p>21.	INTERPRETATION.  The headings of the paragraphs in this License are for convenience of reference only and do not affect the meaning or interpretation of this License.</p>
